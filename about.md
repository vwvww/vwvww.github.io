This is vwvww's blog.

This page is about what I am interested in, and what I will write about.

I'm interested in:

* Browsers(Chromium/Blink, Servo, etc)
* WebApp Frameworks(Cordova, Electron)
* Javascript
* rust

and maybe I will write something about:

- [ ] Using emacs/magit as a git history browser
- [ ] Using gulp to automate building/flashing/testing in openembedded development environment
- [ ] Understanding/customizing your chromium scrollbar
- [ ] Managing jekyll-based blog using emacs

and...more!
